This is my very first blog post. I am a musician, blogger, designer and developer from Vienna, Austria.
There are many things I like to do and explore.
So if there is anything I really want to talk about, then this is the place you should look, if you want to know about it.
If I experience anything bloody amazing I’ll also write something about it here.
Furthermore, I will also use this website as a place to publish my projects, mixtapes and designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Hello World! This is my very first blog post. I am a musician, blogger, designer and developer from Vienna, Austria.
