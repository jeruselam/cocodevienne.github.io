## About
This mixtape is for a very special person! A person who has always stood by me and has always been there for me. You know who you are, this is for you. But there is also another purpose of uploading this mixtape: I made it when I was feeling particularly down and bad about life and the world in general. After listening to it I felt much better and it gave me new energy. To everyone out there who is having some kind of hardship: Stop and think about why you are sad and always remember that anyone who has to make you feel bad in order to make themselves feel better is the poorer one, not you! This mixtape is for everyone who is feeling lonely, everyone who is getting mobbed by others, everyone who is having a bad day, everyone who broke up with their partner and everyone who needs some kind of help. This is my anti-bullying mixtape. I recently finished school and my entire school life was disrupted because of bullying. This is for everyone who is going through something similar. Help each other and love each other. <3

Yours truly.
