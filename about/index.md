I am a musician, blogger, designer and developer from Vienna, Austria. I also DJ and compose/write my own songs.
There are many things I like to do and explore. Besides being bloody amazing at everything I do I am also very open about my views and opinions. Now some people might not like what I have to say but I don' really care about those anyway. If you want to know more about me, check me out on social media. The links are listed below.

Yours truly,

Alex de Vienne aka Coco de Vienne aka Le Tigre
