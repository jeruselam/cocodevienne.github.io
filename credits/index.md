So because I feel like it and it is in order to do so, I want to thank a few people and organisations. First of all I want to thank all my family for being very supportive. Next, I want to thank my friends for always being there to help me in times of need. Lastly, I want to thank GitHub and the open source community for supporting me, providing me with the technologies I need and (@GitHub especially) for hosting this website! Now because they are always there for me and I absoultely love them here's a shoutout to @chris_tinax, @tobixvi, @floramerl! Please follow them on Instagram!!

Yours truly,

Alex de Vienne aka Coco de Vienne aka Le Tigre
